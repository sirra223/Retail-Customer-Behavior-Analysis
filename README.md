# Retail-Customer-Behavior-Analysis
Customer behavior analysis using 80K+ H&amp;M transactions. Conducted cohort segmentation, price distribution analysis, repeat purchase metrics, and color preference exploration using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) to derive retail insights.

# Project Overview
This project explores customer purchasing behavior using a sampled version of the H&M Personalized Fashion Recommendations dataset.
The objective was to analyze how age, product category, price, repeat purchases, and color preferences interact to reveal meaningful retail insights.
The dataset used contains:
80,000 transactions
30,000 customers
Multiple product categories and 40+ color groups
All analyses were conducted using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

# Research Questions
This project answers four key questions:
Do different age groups prefer different product categories?
Does age influence how much customers spend?
Which product categories drive repeat purchases?
What colors dominate customer buying behavior?

# Key Findings
Upper-body garments dominate purchases across all age groups.
Product category influences price more than age does.
Upper-body garments drive the strongest repeat purchase behavior.
Neutral colors (Black, White, Beige) dominate across all demographics.
Overall, customer behavior patterns are more consistent across age groups than expected.

# Methods
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Age cohort segmentation
Price scaling and distribution analysis
Repeat purchase metric calculation
Data visualization (heatmaps, box plots, violin plots, treemaps, stacked bar charts)

# Tools
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook

# Dataset
Dataset sourced from Kaggle: H&M Personalized Fashion Recommendations.
For reproducibility and performance, a representative sample was used instead of the full dataset.

# Future Work
Incorporate seasonal and time-based analysis
Apply clustering for behavioral segmentation
Develop recommendation modeling approaches
